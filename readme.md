This project is divided into a few sections that were developed over time.

The main sections are:

* **OOP**: This scene is the primary OOD prototype implementation, with the scene and scripts used for it in the [same folder](Assets/Scenes/OOP)
* **DOP**: This scene is the primary DOD prototype implementation, with the scene and scripts used for it in the [same folder](Assets/Scenes/DOP)

Apart from that, there are other implementations (for OOD prototyping) in the old [OOP_Game](Assets/Scripts/OOP_Game).

Another section showed the initial implementations of OOD and DOD when the files were being created and DOD was being learned. These files can be found [here](Assets/Testing/Test%20Scenes).

Lastly, a part of the project comes from Matthew J. Spencer, who did a fantastic job showcasing multiple implementations and uses regarding DOD, cache, and GPU usage. Which project can be found on [his link](https://github.com/Matthew-J-Spencer/pushing-unity) or in [this repository](Assets/Testing/_Game) used for testing and learning purposes.

Other folders like [Samples](Assets/Samples) contain implementations that came from established packages to learn their implementations.

Lastly, the [Plugins](Assets/Plugins) folder contains multiple Asset Store projects that helped me to learn more about the implementations and code-specific problems and studying about the DOD paradigm overall.
